The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding FLLogs as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the ```dependencies``` value of your ```Package.swift```.

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Nickelfox/FLLogs", .branch("develop"))
]
```
